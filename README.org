*What is armacs?*

Unlike Spacemacs or Doom Emacs, Armacs does not intend to be a drop in replacement for any mainstream text editor. Armacs is designed with a few things in mind:
- Encourage understanding how emacs works and write their own config files.   
- Novice users of emacs wouldn't have to setup basic functionalities.
- The config isn't too complicated so that users will be able to make changes to the config without breaking anything.
- Armacs put first priority to proper documentaion so that the users know what each package/configuration does.

*I'm not in a position to spent time on config files at the moment. What are my alternatives?*

You are in luck. I have two great options for you. Check both out and pick what works for you:
- [[http://spacemacs.org/][Spacemacs]] : A community-driven Emacs distribution.
- [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom Emacs]] : Doom is a configuration for GNU Emacs. It can be used as framework for your own configuration, or as a resource for fellow Emacs enthusiasts who want to learn more about our favorite OS
** Installation 
CLone this repo into your home folder if the folder is not named =.emacs.d=, rename the folder to =.emacs.d=.
1. If you have an existing Emacs configuration, back it up first:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   cd ~
   mv .emacs.d .emacs.d.bak
   mv .emacs .emacs.bak
   #+END_SRC
   Don't forget to backup and *remove* `~/.emacs` file otherwise armacs
   *WILL NOT* load since that file prevents Emacs from loading the proper
   initialization file.

2. Clone the repository:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   git clone https://github.com/avronr/armacs ~/.emacs.d
   #+END_SRC

3. Switch to stable branch:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   git checkout master
   #+END_SRC
   
** Configuration
When Emacs is started, it normally tries to load a Lisp program from an “initialization file”, or “init file” for short. This file, if it exists, specifies how to initialize Emacs for you. Emacs looks for your init file using the filenames ‘~/.emacs’, ‘~/.emacs.el’, or ‘~/.emacs.d/init.el’. Here all the init.el file does is point to the config.org file. All of the actual configuration is done in the ~/.emacs.d/config.org file.
** Contributing
You can fork the repo and make changes. As I said earlier, documentation is important here so whatever you do make sure you explain what you are doing or your change may not be accepted to the main repo.
